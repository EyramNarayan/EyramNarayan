# 👋 Hi, I’m just… here  

![shrug gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYt5jPR6QX5pnqM/giphy.gif)  

I’m not really a developer.  
I’m just some average person who occasionally breaks stuff with code,  
and then pretends it was on purpose.

## 🌭 Skills (kinda)
- Eating 3-day-old pizza without regret  
- Accidentally sleeping through alarms like it’s an Olympic sport  
- Clicking “Remind me later” on updates until the heat death of the universe  
- Copy-pasting code I don’t understand (and somehow it works)

## 🕹 Projects I Pretend to Care About
- **Cloud Storage for Nothing™** – Upload files → get nothing back. You’re welcome.  
- Considering a startup that delivers air in jars 💨  
- Writing README files like this instead of being productive

## 📖 A Totally Random Story
One time, I was walking home at 2 AM, carrying fries.  
A stray cat stared at me like it wanted one.  
So I gave it a fry. The cat didn’t eat it.  
It just stared at me harder.  
Anyway, that was the most intense job interview I’ve ever had.

## 📫 Contact
Send me an email… or a pigeon.  
The pigeon will probably get a faster reply.
